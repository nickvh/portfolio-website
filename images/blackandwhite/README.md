# Black & White Photos

Place your black and white photos in this folder.

## Getting Started

1. Add your black and white photos to this folder
2. Open `gallery-bw.js` in the project root
3. Add the filenames to the `bwImages` array:

```javascript
const bwImages = [
    'photo1.jpg',
    'photo2.jpg',
    'photo3.jpg',
    // Add more...
];
```

4. Save and refresh your website

## Auto-Update (Coming Soon)

The image list generator will be updated to automatically scan this folder as well.
